This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project

This project is made to handle weekly planning of meals, as well as give the user a detailed shopping-list based on the ingredients coming from the recipes planned for said week.

The project is written in React(Next.js), with Typescript & TailwindCSS - Reasoning for this is that I wanted to learn Next.js  having only used client side React & CSS/SASS previously.

Components are used from Shadcn(https://ui.shadcn.com/) as this gives me the control to handle each component as I want to and not overload the node.modules.
